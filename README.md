Listening to Cardiff Bus Central Control on 178.25000 MHz can be quite interesting.

I made a fun little app so you can find out more details about the bus they are communicating with, as they use the fleet number, rather than the route number.

To use this, just run the app with the fleet number as the first parameter.

`dotnet run 123`
or
`cardiffbus.exe 123`
